      <h4>A Balance Between Progress & Purpose...</h4>
      <p> Contest and competition tend to be synonymous terms. Ironically, skateboarding contests lack a competitive mindset.
          In a Route One interview with Mark Suciu, he states that "Competitive attitudes push you towards greater feats, and
          I'm interested in the the greater feat...In a contest, it doesn't help. It's the wrong outlet". Contests tend to limit
          skaters to their own personal tricks that they're comfortable with. Mark elaborates on that idea, discussing how no one
          attempts to 'one-up' each other.

          One of the greatest experiences within skateboarding is witnessing progression in yourself, others, and the industry.
          It would be an understatement to say how mind blowing skateboarding has become. The question is, can we still continue to
          push the boundaries? Can we still continue to exceed our expectations of what was possible? This platform was created
          to continue asking ourselves that question and to achieve those greater feats. It is meant to revive that competitive mindset,
          not in an egotistical sense, but to support the culture and progression of skateboarding... a balance between
          progress and purpose.
